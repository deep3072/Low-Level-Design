## SOLID Principles

This section contains examples and explanations of the SOLID principles in object-oriented design. Each principle is demonstrated with `before` and `after` examples.

- [Open/Closed Principle](#open-closed-principle)
- [Liskov Substitution Principle](#liskov-substitution-principle)
- [Interface Segregation Principle](#interface-segregation-principle)
- [Dependency Inversion Principle](#dependency-inversion-principle)


## Design Patterns

This section contains implementation of standard design patterns that are standard solutions to recurring problems and handle them in a certain way.

- [Behavioral](#behavioral)
- [Creational](#creational)
- [Structural](#structural)
