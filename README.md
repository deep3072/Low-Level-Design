# Low-Level Designüí°

The goal of this repository is to get better understanding of Design Patterns, Low-Level Design, SOLID principles and Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) concepts in Python. It contains various case studies and their implementations in Python.

## Fundamentals üìö
This section contains implementation from some basic concepts in Python to advanced topics like Dynamic Protocols and Meta Programming.

## SOLID Principles üõ†Ô∏è

This section focuses to show the importance of SOLID principles. It contains the `before` examples to show a class violating the principle, while the `after` examples show a refactored class adhering to the principle.
- [Single Responsibility](https://github.com/deep3072/Low-Level-Design/tree/main/SOLID%20Principles/Single%20Responsibility)
- [Open/Closed](https://github.com/deep3072/Low-Level-Design/tree/main/SOLID%20Principles/Open%20Close)
- [Liskov Substitution](https://github.com/deep3072/Low-Level-Design/tree/main/SOLID%20Principles/Liskov%20Substitution)
- [Interface Segregation](https://github.com/deep3072/Low-Level-Design/tree/main/SOLID%20Principles/Interface%20Segregation)
- [Dependency Inversion](https://github.com/deep3072/Low-Level-Design/tree/main/SOLID%20Principles/Dependency%20Inversion)
