## SOLID Principles
This repository contains examples and explanations of the SOLID principles in object-oriented design.

### Structure

The repository is structured into directories for each principle, with `before` and `after` examples demonstrating the application of each principle. The `before` examples show a class violating the principle, while the `after` examples show a refactored class adhering to the principle.

### Purpose

The purpose of this repository is to understand and implement the SOLID principles by providing before and after examples in Python. The focus is on demonstrating the principles rather than on the actual implementation logic.
